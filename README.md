```
Reducers

7. In your own words, describe how to set up Redux for a React App.

```
First, npm install react-redux "name of app". Next create a src folder, inside of that create three more folders. Components, Store, and Styles. Components refer to your different components on your webpage. Store holds your Reducers and Actions folders as well as your App.js and index.js. Styles is for styles. One created add boilerplate import exports and name your .JS files accordingly to your project. Good luck!
